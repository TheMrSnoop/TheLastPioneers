    <h1>2025 Summer Update</h1>
    <h3>JUNE 6, 2025 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">Because I spent the last few months further developing frameworks and such, and now that I have 3 months of free time, I am going to lean heavily in creating many planned needed missions.</p>
    <p>First I have to actually know what it is I am creating, since other then like 3 or so levels, most of the at least 12 missions weren't thought about much. As of writing this, I am planning to make 18 missions, that have each been designed and fit well into a story I am trying to tell. </p>

    <h4>Procedurally Generated Animations</h4>
    <p>Unreal Engine 5.6 allows for the procedural generation of locomotion animations, in real time. I tried implementing this new feature to the Spider bot that I have had lying around for over 5 months now. It turns out, its only really meant for animations, and not games. Either way, it pushed me to finally start developing my own custom version of this feature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I won't get super technical but basically, each leg shoots invisible rays in order to detect where the ground is, in relation to that leg. Then, the leg will dynamically move in a way so that the foot of the leg, is flat with whatever that line came in contact with. I then have the legs independently move in a way to where it looks like the bot as a whole, is walking.</p>
