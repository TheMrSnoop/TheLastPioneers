    <h5>The Last Pioneers Game-Dev</h5>
    <h1>2024 Fall Update</h1>
    <h3>NOVEMBER 24, 2024 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">
        It had been over 4 months since the last build of the game. Most of that time was spent just refining, and perfecting the groundwork I had laid for all the core elements of The Last Pioneers.
    </p>

    <p>I spent a lot of time making a test map. It's a secret Soviet Facility that is located on the North Martian Pole. I might end up coming back to the barebones map, I might not, but it taught me a lot about level design, since it was kind of the first real level I would work on for the game. Basically all the meshes in this level were made using a free asset pack from the Unreal Marketplace, again, this was more so just a test level. I now try to avoid using asset packs for actual levels.</p>

    <h4>Creating a new Intro Mission</h4>

    <p>
        I decided to not use a tutorial mission I had spent June and July working on, and started working on a Military Basic Training level instead. This is where I spent about 2 months trying to perfect the place, just to also not use this new one in the end. 
    </p>
    <p>Note: Many of the assets in this level, are also from asset packs.</p>

    <h4>Other Things</h4>

    <p>I also worked on, and created different variations of the "Interactive Landing Menu". Basically, I wanted something more than a simple UI, even if it looked cool. This is why I experimented with different effects, like warping, and such. It's important to note that I worked more on the look of it, rather than the functionality of it (it is still missing some basic features).</p>

    <p>
        I learned how to properly implement Artificial Intelligence using Unreal's blackboards and Behavior trees. I had made AI before, like the enemy ship AI in space combat, but it was entirely done in blueprint. I decided to make the ground troop enemy AI's using the Behavior tree so that it would be cleaner to work with.
